                    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took<img  src="images.jpg" alt="this is an image"/> a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the<p><b> this is a work</b></p> leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
